# Classification-Part-1

A classifier is a model that predicts a **discrete label** when shown a set of predictors. Classifiers can be defined as partitions of the **predictor space** into decision regions. A decision region is a region within the predictor space such that any sample that lies within it is assigned the same label.

 # Logistic function: The certainty of a linear classifier
 
Now that we have defined and visualised a linear classifier, we can create the notion of classifier's certainty using the **logistic function** (also known as expit or sigmoid)

Let's see how we can use the logistic function to define the notion of certainty in classifiers. We will first create a new linear classifier defined by new coefficients and show the decision regions that it defines:
